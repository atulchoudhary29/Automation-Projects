# Twitter-Bot

Twitter-Bot is an automation tool built with Python and the Selenium Automation Framework. Since the Twitter API is expensive and difficult to access, this takes its place. It allows you to tweet, retweet based on keywords, like tweets on the site, and like tweets based on keywords. 

## How to Install

1. Create a ```python``` virtual environment. 
2. Clone the repo.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory. 
4. Run ``` pip3 install selenium ``` and ``` pip3 install webdriver_manager```
5. And now you can run the example scripts or create your own scripts.  

## Usage
- To like tweets on the homepage, run ``` python3 homepage_tweets_like.py```
- To like tweets based on keyword, run ``` python3 keyword_tweets_like.py```
- To post a tweet, run ``` python3 post_tweet.py```
- To retweet based on keyword, run ``` python3 keyword_tweets_retweet.py```
